The percentage of characters that were non-white: 5%

The percentage of characters that were women: 29%

The cartoonist which had the highest percentage of non-white characters is Haefeli

The percentage of characters who were both non-white and female is 0

From the results I obtained, itâ€™s clear that non-white and female characters were the minorities in the cartoons.  There is a small percentage
of non-white characters and they were all males. The women in these cartoons were only white women. There was no inclusion of diversty for the females
in the cartoons. There were no non-white female characters. These findings clearly reflect that these cartoons used a over 70% male characters
and only 5% of them were non-white. These cartoons were dominated by white males.
